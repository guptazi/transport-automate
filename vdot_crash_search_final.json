This geospatial dataset is the accident file from the FARS 2023 Final Release Data. The Final Release Data is published 12-15 months, after the initial release of FARS, and could contain additional fatal accidents due to the delay in police reporting, toxicology reports, etc., along with changes to attribute information for previously reported fatal accidents.
