This data layer was created for Speed Zone application of Roadway Network System by extracting the zone location information for each feature from the speed zone database and then applying this location description to the linear referencing system built for the Virginia roadway network, and then associating the zone business data to the spatially located feature. Over time new speed zones are created that may overlap - supersede an existing zone. This layer uses business rules to calculate the speed limit. A conventional zone and a variable limit may exist at a single selected location. This data set is maintained by RNS application. There are two types of SPZ records first are for \"Statutory\" zones where signs are erected to mark roads on which the statutory speed limits apply. The second type of zone is \"Resolution\" in which the VDOT Commissioner approves changes in speed limits based on recommendations from TED following traffic studies at the proposed location. In these cases the speed limit may be set to any recommended value, in 5 mph increments, and with differing speed limits for trucks versus other vehicles, different speed limits based on time of day, etc.<\/span><\/p><\/div><\/div><\/div>","tags":["VDOT","Virginia","Transportation","Speed","Limit","Speed Limit","Speed Limits"],"snippet":"This service displays Posted Speed Limits on VDOT maintained highways in Virginia.
